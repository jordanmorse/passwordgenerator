This assignment was to create a password generator that would allow the user to input their preferences and 
write a script that would randomly generate a password based on the criteria picked by the user. Options included
uppercase/lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The password needs to be between 8-128 characters total.
Uses a combination of functions, objects, arrays and for loops in Javascript.

User will click "generate password" button and respond to a series of prompts which will then generate a random password.
